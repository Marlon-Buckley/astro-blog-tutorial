  <h2>This is my new Astro site!</h2>

  <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

  <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>

  {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

  {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

  {goal === 3 ? <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>}

  <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>

  <Identity 
    firstName={identity.firstName} 
    country={identity.country} 
    occupation={identity.occupation} 
    hobbies={identity.hobbies}>
  </Identity>

  <p>My skills (barely...) are:</p>
  <ul>
    {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
  </ul>
</BaseLayout>
